### JEI Power

**“Jury of Eternal Insight”**

🌌 Thematic Strengths:

• “Jury” → implies selection, judgment, and that the player was evaluated and approved for this power — very isekai.

• “Eternal” → timelessness, fits with the idea of ancient knowledge crossing worlds.

• “Insight” → perfect to represent the power of JEI — the player sees what others can’t: recipes, item uses, automation paths.

🔮 Optional Lore Snippet:

_Bestowed upon those pulled through the veil between realms, the Jury of Eternal Insight grants its bearer the ability to peer beyond mortal craftsmanship — to uncover the hidden patterns of all creation._

You could even integrate it narratively — like a tutorial message or tooltip:

“You feel a strange pull in your mind… The Jury of Eternal Insight has spoken. You see how to create what should be impossible.”
